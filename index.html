            <p title="Info about How Round-Robin Scheduling algorithm works" >Round-robin scheduling is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that allocates CPU time to processes in equal time slices, known as "quantum." When a process finishes its quantum, it's preempted, and the CPU switches to the next process in the queue. This ensures fairness among processes, making it ideal for time-sharing systems and interactive environments. However, it may cause inefficiencies for long-running or variable workload processes due to frequent context switches.</p>

        <p title="Info about How Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock works">The Banker's Algorithm prevents deadlocks by analyzing resource requests dynamically and only granting them if the system remains in a safe state, where deadlock cannot occur. It tracks available resources and process maximums, ensuring requests can be met without risking deadlock. If a request threatens system stability, it's deferred until resources are available, maintaining system safety.</p>

        <p title="Info about How SCAN Disk Scheduling Algo works">The SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, also known as the elevator algorithm, is used in operating systems to optimize disk access. It works by moving the disk arm in one direction until it reaches the end of the disk, serving all requests along the way. Then, it reverses direction and serves requests in the opposite direction until it reaches the other end of the disk. This approach minimizes disk arm movement, reducing access time and improving disk performance.</p>
