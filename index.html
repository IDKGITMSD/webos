        <p title="Info about How Round-Robin Scheduling algorithm works" style="color:cornsilk;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif ;">Round-robin scheduling is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that allocates CPU time to each process in equal time slices, typically referred to as "quantum" or "time slice." When a process exhausts its allocated time quantum, it is preempted, and the CPU is assigned to the next process in the ready queue. This continues until all processes have been executed. Round-robin scheduling ensures fairness by providing each process with an equal share of CPU time, making it suitable for time-sharing systems and environments with interactive applications. However, it may result in poor performance for long-running processes or those with varying computational requirements due to frequent context switches.</p>

        <!--Second topic same-->
        <p title="Info about How Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock works"style="color:cornsilk;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif ;">The Banker's Algorithm prevents deadlocks by analyzing resource requests dynamically and only granting them if the system remains in a safe state, where deadlock cannot occur. It tracks available resources and process maximums, ensuring requests can be met without risking deadlock. If a request threatens system stability, it's deferred until resources are available, maintaining system safety.</p>

It ensures fair and efficient handling of disk I/O requests, reducing access time and enhancing disk performance."style="color:azure ;">3.SCAN Disc scheduling Algorithm</h3>
        <!--third topic same-->
        <p title="Info about How SCAN Disk Scheduling Algo works"style="color:cornsilk;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif ;">The SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, also known as the elevator algorithm, is used in operating systems to optimize disk access. It works by moving the disk arm in one direction until it reaches the end of the disk, serving all requests along the way. Then, it reverses direction and serves requests in the opposite direction until it reaches the other end of the disk. This approach minimizes disk arm movement, reducing access time and improving disk performance.</p>
